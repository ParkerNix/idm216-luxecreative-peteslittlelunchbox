                        <p>From these mood boards, our group agreed that we would combine a graphic style with photorealism that would come from the 
                           images of the food. We were inspired by the existing menu design, but wanted to modernize their look.</p>

                        <p>For all of the typography in our app, we used the font family 'Gilroy.' To introduce visual hierarchy, we used different 
                        weights of the font, as well as designated styles for call to actions within the app. The red and blue color palette is 
                        derived from the original colors of the truck, however, we made the tones slightly cooler for a more modern feel.</p>
