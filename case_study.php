        <h1>Case Study</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, I was to create a recipe website that uses PHP as the main scripting language in order 
                to learn more about server-side development and working with databases. After looking at other recipe pages, 
                I aimed to make mine simple and breathable, without all the extra things that recipe websites tend to put 
                on their pages. To accomplish this, I designed the site as a prototype first, then coded out a static 
                version of it. After this, I applied PHP code to my site that allowed users to add, view, edit, and delete 
                recipes. Finally, I added in more recipes and did some finishing touches (Like adding more recipes) before 
                calling it done. The end product was a success as it had all the functionality that I had originally 
                intended for the site to have and it was simple and breathable.</p>

            <h2>Context and Challenges</h2>
            <p class="case">For this project, I had to create a recipe site that functioned with PHP as the main scripting 
                language. The purpose of which was to learn about the basics of server-side coding by making a larger site 
                that generates pages based on a database.
                My site was called Recipe & Me, and my intention for it was to be very simple and easy to use. Using other 
                recipe websites, I’ve seen that a big problem is that they often have a lot of things on the page, which 
                makes me feel very overwhelmed. Therefore, I wanted this focus on giving this site some breathing room 
                between elements. My main goals were to have a system to add, view, edit, and delete recipes, use a simplified 
                design for my site, and make sure everything on my page is functioning well.</p>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <div class="process">
                <img class="images big" src="images/figma.png" alt="Figma prototype">
                <p>To start, I designed a Figma file that would be the starting point for what my website would look like. I 
                    used a tan for the main color on my site and used mostly greys for the rest of the page in order to keep 
                    most of the color with the pictures of food that go with each recipe. I found this process to be pretty fun,
                    as it was nice to just think about how to arrange things on the page without having to dig into the details 
                    of how to code it.</p>

                <img class="images big" src="images/Alpha.png" alt="Alpha">
                <p>Next, I worked on creating the static version of my site, without PHP. This wasn’t terribly difficult and it 
                    was nice to refresh myself on how to use certain elements like flexbox and grid. One challenge that I had 
                    here was coding with the intent of eventually adding in the PHP features. For the most part, I could just 
                    take what I had from the design I made and code it out, but I was worried about setting it up in such a way 
                    that I’d have to go back and re-code things out. To solve this, I looked into how coding PHP works in advance, 
                    and I was even able to add in some basic PHP that just makes it easier to code in the header and footer for 
                    each page.</p>

                <img class="images big" src="images/Beta.png" alt="Beta">
                <p>After this, it was time to really get into PHP. I was really excited for this step because I was really looking 
                    forward to learning more so I’d have experience when applying to co-ops. The first thing I did was connect my 
                    site to a database that I created to store the information for each recipe. Then, I created the code that would 
                    be used to add recipes to the database. These two steps were probably the hardest because they required a lot 
                    of focus to understand why they weren’t working. However, this helped me on the rest of the steps because I knew 
                    how to code each part in. After that I built in the functionality for viewing, editing, and deleting recipes. 
                    This was really fun and satisfying to use once I was done.</p>

                <img class="images big" src="images/Final.png" alt="Final">
                <p>Lastly, I needed to add in recipes, as well as putting in some finishing touches. I made the search function work
                    and entered in data for a bunch of recipes. This step was really easy compared to connecting the database to my
                    site, as there wasn't a lot to learn, just a lot of recipes to enter. Learning how to implement a search button was
                    super helpful for me because it's a skill that I think a lot of websites need to have a great user experience.
                    Without it, many pages would take forever to find if the site is too big.

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <a href="http://parkerishere.com/IDM232"><p>Link to the final product</p></a>
            <p>My final site opens to a homepage. “All recipes” takes you to a list of the recipes on the page, and clicking on one 
                will show you more details on the recipe. There’s a button on the details page to edit an item, and clicking on that 
                takes you to a page where you can edit the title, description, ingredients, and steps of each page. At the bottom is 
                a button to delete recipes, which will permanently remove them. You can also add new recipes at the bottom of the page 
                using the “New Recipe” button, and the page for that is about the same as the page for editing recipes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>In the end, I found that my project was successful. My page is capable of adding, viewing, editing, and deleting recipes 
                and everything on my page functions as expected. In addition, it has a very simplified feel that offers the user a 
                layout that doesn’t feel like it has no breathing room. Many of the family and friends that I showed the page to noted 
                that the site felt very clean, but also inviting and warm. This indicates to me that I’ve been successful in my goals.
                I also learned a lot in this process. Of course, I learned how to code in PHP and the interworkings of back-end 
                development. This was the thing I was looking most forward to when I began this project, and I feel like I’ve gained a 
                lot of knowledge on it. However, I also learned a lot about how to manage time when learning something new. Learning how 
                to implement the database in my site took a good amount of time to learn, and I felt like I had to rush a bit to finish 
                because of it. Next time, I’ll be more generous with how long I give myself to fully understand a concept in respect to 
                the deadline I have to finish the project I need to apply it to.</p>
